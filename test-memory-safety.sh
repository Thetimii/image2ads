# Test different scenarios
test_file_size 1   # 1MB - safe
test_file_size 2   # 2MB - safe  
test_file_size 3   # 3MB - borderline
test_file_size 5   # 5MB - needs client resize
test_file_size 8   # 8MB - needs client resize
test_file_size 12  # 12MB - needs client resize

echo "💡 Key Improvements:"
echo "   • Edge function now rejects files >3MB BEFORE decoding"
echo "   • Client-side resize ensures all uploads are <2.5MB"
echo "   • No more 269MB memory usage in Edge functions"
echo "   • Recursive reduction if first resize attempt still too large"
echo ""

echo "🔧 Integration Steps:"
echo "   1. Use resizeImageFile() in your upload components"
echo "   2. Set maxOutputSize: 2_500_000 in resize options"
echo "   3. Use format: 'jpeg' for smaller files (unless transparency needed)"
echo "   4. Test with large images (4000×3000+)"

echo "✅ Edge function deployed with 3MB strict limit!"
echo "✅ Client-side utilities updated with 2.5MB target"
echo "✅ Ready for memory-safe uploads!"
